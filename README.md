# Data Science Academy - Exploratory Data Analysis on Retail Sales with Python

This project was developed as part of the "Fundamentals of Python for Data Analysis and Data Science" course at Data Science Academy.

## Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset using Python. The goal is to answer various business-related questions about sales, discounts, and product performance, with interactive visualizations of the results.
